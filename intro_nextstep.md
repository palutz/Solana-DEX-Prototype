# Solana DEX Prototype (Group 5)
https://github.com/alloc33/Solana-DEX-Prototype

Following up on my quick demo, here's some additional info about our DEX project:

## Core Functionality
- **AMM Implementation**: Built a complete Automated Market Maker on Solana with the constant product formula (x*y=k)
- **Liquidity Pools**: Users can create pools, add/remove liquidity, and earn fees
- **Token Swapping**: Traders can swap between any token pair with slippage protection
- **Dual Fee Structure**: Fees split between liquidity providers and protocol

## Technical Highlights
- Built with Anchor framework - Solana's standard for smart contract development
- PDA-based security model for non-custodial operations
- Comprehensive error handling against common DEX vulnerabilities
- Fully tested functionality for all user operations

## Key Code Features
- Constant product formula implementation
- Efficient fee calculation with adjustable parameters
- Secure token transfers using PDAs
- LP token minting with proper share calculation

## What I Learned
- Solana's Account model for DeFi applications
- Implementing secure financial logic for an AMM
- Writing comprehensive tests for blockchain applications
- Fee structure optimization to incentivize liquidity

## Future Enhancements
- Concentrated liquidity (like Uniswap v3)
- Multi-hop swaps for improved routing
- Integration with other DeFi protocols
